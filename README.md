## Micropython
You'll need 1.19, not all firmware appears to work, if you have problems try the one included here https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/9/9d/RP2040-LCD-1.28.zip to test your device. You'll then need download the "Pico with Pimoroni Libraries" via Thonny or https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/releases

All this because I used the ellipse method in framebuf which didn't appear till 1.19. Apparently circles are cutting edge and only just released!

## Printing
Printed on an Ender 3 Neo v2 with standard settings and PLA filament.

## Painting
Sanded down and a couple coats of primer, 4 - 5 coats of spray metalic silver paint. Photo really shows up the layer lines, it's much less noticable in real life and has quite a nice gloss finish.
